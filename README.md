# Geo-BI-DATA-VISUALIZATION
The primary objectives of the Geo-BI Visualization project are:
•	To perform spatial and temporal analysis of agricultural data using geo-tagged datasets.
•	To develop intuitive dashboards using Tableau and Power BI that visualize patterns across time and geography.
•	To forecast harvesting timelines by examining the relationships between crop types, sowing periods, and climatic or regional influences.
•	To support sustainable rural planning by identifying agricultural hotspots and seasonal trends.
•	To demonstrate the utility of integrating GIS with Business Intelligence tools for agriculture-centric big data analysis
